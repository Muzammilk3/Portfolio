# Gmail Contact Form Integration

This contact form now uses Gmail's web interface for sending emails directly, no third-party services required!

## How It Works

1. **User fills out the form** with their name, email, subject, and message
2. **Form validates** all required fields and email format
3. **Gmail opens** in a new tab/window with the email pre-filled
4. **User clicks Send** in Gmail to send the email

## Features

✅ **No external dependencies** - uses Gmail directly  
✅ **Client-side validation** - prevents invalid submissions  
✅ **Responsive design** - works on mobile and desktop  
✅ **Professional formatting** - emails are properly formatted  
✅ **Fallback support** - falls back to default email client if Gmail isn't available  

## How the Email Appears

The generated email will look like this:

```
To: muzammilahmedk3@gmail.com
Subject: Portfolio Contact: [User's Subject]

Hi Muzammil,

Name: [User's Name]
Email: [User's Email]
Subject: [User's Subject]

Message:
[User's Message]

---
Sent from your portfolio contact form
```

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ **Chrome/Edge**: Opens Gmail directly
- ✅ **Firefox**: Opens Gmail directly  
- ✅ **Safari**: Opens Gmail or default email client
- ✅ **Mobile browsers**: Opens Gmail app or email app

## Benefits

1. **No setup required** - works immediately
2. **Secure** - no API keys or sensitive data
3. **Reliable** - uses Gmail's infrastructure
4. **Familiar** - users know how to use Gmail
5. **Professional** - emails come from user's own Gmail account

## Technical Details

The form creates a Gmail URL with pre-filled parameters:
- `to`: Your email address
- `subject`: Portfolio Contact + user's subject
- `body`: Formatted message with all user details

This approach is secure, reliable, and requires no backend server or API configuration.
